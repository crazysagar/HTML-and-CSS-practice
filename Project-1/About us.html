    <b>The game features</b> a variety of game modes, including the main Battle Royale mode, which accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island to fight until one survivor remains, and Clash Squad, a 4v4 mode where teams purchase weapons and items before combat.
 Other modes like Lone Wolf, Big Head, and Pet Mania are available during special events.
 Free Fire also includes a map creation tool called Craftland, allowing players to design and share custom maps.
 The game features over 50 characters, each with unique active or passive skills, and 21 different pets that provide support in battle, some of which are inspired by collaborations with real-life celebrities like Cristiano Ronaldo, Anitta, and Justin Bieber.

In September 2021, Garena launched Free Fire Max, an enhanced version with improved graphics, lighting, and sound effects.
 The game has also seen major collaborations, such as the Free Fire x NARUTO SHIPPUDEN event, which introduced new maps, characters, and abilities based on the anime series.
 The game's official annual esports competition, the Free Fire World Series, set a record as the most-watched esports event at the time, reaching over 5.4 million peak live viewers
