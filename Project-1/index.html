            <b>Free Fire is a free-to-play battle royale game</b> developed by 111 Dots Studio and published by Garena for Android and iOS, released on December 8, 2017.
 It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019 and has since maintained significant popularity, particularly in Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia.
 The game features fast-paced 10-minute matches where up to 50 players compete on an island to be the last one standing, aiming to stay within a shrinking safe zone while eliminating opponents.
 Players can use a joystick to move and a fire button to shoot and throw items, with actions including jumping, crawling, and lying down.
 Key game modes include Battle Royale, Clash Squad (a 4v4 mode), and Lone Wolf.
 The game features a variety of characters, each with unique skills, and pets that provide in-battle support.
 In September 2021, Garena launched Free Fire Max, an enhanced version with improved graphics, lighting, and sound effects.
